# wordlists
2 Wordlists + python program. 

I built 2 wordlists, using a list of names and a program I wrote in python.
One is with English names and one with Italian names.  
How is the wordlist structured?  
The names are repeated all lowercase, all uppercase and first capital letter. 
So: Kevin, kevin, KEVIN.
All combinations of numbers are added next to the name.  
Example: 
Kevin7 (0 to 9),
Kevin23 (00 to 99),
Kevin2000 (1950 to 2023).
All of this is repeated for every single name on the lists. 

Make good use of it =)
